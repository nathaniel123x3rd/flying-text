   	<p class="text">Hi i'm Nathaniel, i'm 15 year old kid from a small country called Suriname. I picked up coding about 3 years ago when I was making Discord Bots but these days I am way more into web designing languages such as HTML, CSS, and JS. I have already mastered HTML and CSS so I wanted to learn a Javascript library. I can't decide which one to learn so I decided to learn a little bit of everything. For this month I am learning AnimeJS which surprisingly powers this website. It will be very difficult for you to read this haha.</p>
